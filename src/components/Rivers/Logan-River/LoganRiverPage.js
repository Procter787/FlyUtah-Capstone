    The Logan River rises in the Bear River Mountains in Idaho and flows south, then southwest through Logan Canyon and the Wasatch-Cache National Forest to the city of Logan, Utah, in the Cache Valley. In this valley it joins the Little Bear River a few miles west of Logan and about 5 miles (8 km) south of where the Little Bear River joins the Bear River.
